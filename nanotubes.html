    <h3>Nanotubes</h3>
    <p>
        Nanotubes are a unique class of materials because their properties depend not only on their composition but also on their geometry. The diameter, number of walls, length, chirality, van der Waals forces, and quality all affect the properties and performance of nanotubes. This dependence on geometry is what makes scaling-up nanotubes to form bulk material so challenging. Nanotubes are also unusual because they stick together to form bundles or strands. Nanotube superfiber materials are fibrous assemblages of nanotubes and strands. The hope and dream of researchers around the world is that nanotube superfiber materials will have broad applications and change engineering design. This chapter gives a perspective on nanotube superfiber development. This chapter discusses new applications—where we think we can go with the material properties and what applications will be enabled—and new techniques for developing superfiber material.<br>
