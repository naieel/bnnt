    <h3>Nitride</h3>
    <p> In chemistry, a nitride is a compound of nitrogen where nitrogen has a formal oxidation state of −3. Nitrides are a large class of compounds with a wide range of properties and applications. The nitride ion, N3−, is never encountered in protic solution because it is so basic that it would be protonated immediately and its ionic radius is estimated to be 140 pm. </p>
